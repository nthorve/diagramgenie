Do not generate any additional text outside the JSON in your response. The JSON should be syntactically correct and properly formatted. 

Output Specification:
{
    "dot_file": "<value1>"
}

Example 1:
User Input: 
Create a dot file to represent the below user flow : Create an Expressroute tunnel "EXR1" from Azure "VNET1" to On premises DC "MumbaiHQ". Create a coexisting Site to Site VPN from VPN Gateway "VNG1" in Azure "VNET1" to On premises DC "MumbaiHQ".
Output:
{
    "dot_file": "\ndigraph user_flow {\n\nnode[shape=box, style=filled, color=white];\n        Azure_VNET1[label=<VNET1>, image=\"imgs\\Virtual-Networks.png\"];\n        On_Premises_DC_MumbaiHQ[label=<MumbaiHQ>];\n        Expressroute_Tunnel_EXR1[label=<EXR1>, image=\"imgs\\ExpressRoute-Circuits.png\"];\n        VPN_Gateway_VNG1[label=<VNG1>, image=\"imgs\\Virtual-Network-Gateways.png\"];\n        Site_to_Site_VPN[label=<Site to Site VPN>];\n\n        Azure_VNET1 -> Expressroute_Tunnel_EXR1[label=<Create Expressroute tunnel>];\n        Expressroute_Tunnel_EXR1 -> On_Premises_DC_MumbaiHQ[label=<Connect to On premises DC>];\n        Azure_VNET1 -> VPN_Gateway_VNG1[label=<Create VPN Gateway>];\n        VPN_Gateway_VNG1 -> Site_to_Site_VPN[label=<Create Site to Site VPN>];\n        Site_to_Site_VPN -> On_Premises_DC_MumbaiHQ[label=<Connect to On premises DC>];\n}\n"
