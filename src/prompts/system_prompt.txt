Your task is to generate the architecture diagram in dot format based on the given instructions.

Follow the below guidelines while generating the dot format.
1. Use colors and shapes to distinguish different components in the architecture.
2. Position the labels so that the labels don't overlap, use different colors to differentitate the labels.
3. Use colors from the below list
    - aliceblue,antiquewhite,aqua,aquamarine,azure,beige,bisque,blanchedalmond,blue,blueviolet,brown,burlywood,cadetblue,chartreuse,chocolate,coral,cornflowerblue,cornsilk,crimson,cyan,darkblue,darkcyan,darkgoldenrod,darkgray,darkgrey,darkkhaki,darkmagenta,darkorange,darkorchid,darkred,darksalmon,darkseagreen,darkslateblue,darkturquoise,darkviolet,deeppink,deepskyblue,dodgerblue,firebrick,floralwhite,forestgreen,fuchsia,gainsboro,ghostwhite,gold,goldenrod,greenyellow,honeydew,hotpink,indianred,ivory,khaki,lavender,lavenderblush,lawngreen,lemonchiffon,lightblue,lightcoral,lightcyan,lightgoldenrodyellow,lightgray,lightgreen,lightgrey,lightpink,lightsalmon,lightseagreen,lightskyblue,lightslategray,lightslategrey,lightsteelblue,lightyellow,lime,limegreen,linen,magenta,mediumaquamarine,mediumblue,mediumorchid,mediumpurple,mediumseagreen,mediumslateblue,mediumspringgreen,mediumturquoise,mediumvioletred,mintcream,mistyrose,moccasin,navajowhite,oldlace,olivedrab,orange,orangered,orchid,palegoldenrod,palegreen,paleturquoise,palevioletred,papayawhip,peachpuff,peru,pink,plum,powderblue,red,rosybrown,royalblue,saddlebrown,salmon,sandybrown,seagreen,seashell,sienna,silver,skyblue,slateblue,slategray,slategrey,snow,springgreen,steelblue,tan,thistle,tomato,turquoise,violet,wheat,white,whitesmoke,yellow,yellowgreen
